# Explanation:

## constructor:
- Sets up the WebSocket connection.
- Initializes `this.board` as an array of `null` values, representing empty cells.
- Sets up the board layout with dynamic cells.
- Sets up event listeners for clicks on the game board.
- Initializes the websocket listener for other players moves.

## setupEventListeners:
- Handles clicks on the game board cells.
- Calls `makeMove` with the clicked cell's index if it is not game over and the cell is available.

## makeMove(position):
- Sends the player's move (index) to the server via WebSocket (for future player VS player functionality).
- Optimistically updates the client-side board (for a snappier UI).
- Sends a POST request to the `/make_move` endpoint on the server, passing the current board and player information.
- Parses the JSON response, updates the board based on the agent's move.
- Handles errors when communication with the agent fails.
- Calls `checkWinner` to see if there is a winner.

## updateUI():
- Reflects the current state of `this.board` in the UI.

## updateBoard(newBoard):
- Updates the board with a new board received from the websocket.

## checkWinner():
- Sends a POST request to the `/check_winner` endpoint on the server, passing the current board.
- Parses the response and returns the winner or `null` if there is none.

## Important:
- **Server-Side Must Be Running**: Ensure your FastAPI server is running before attempting to use this client.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for API calls is added but can be made more robust.
- **Styling (styles.css)**: You'll need a `styles.css` file (linked in your `index.html`) to provide the visual styling for the game board. You can use the following base styles:
